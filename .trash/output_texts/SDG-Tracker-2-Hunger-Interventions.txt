Interventions SLU Hunger Intervention
Saint Louis University provides interventions to prevent or alleviate hunger among students.
The Project Daily Bread PDB was conceived in response to the cases that have come to the
attention of the SLU Guidance Center regarding students who experience involuntary
hunger. The term “Project Daily Bread” was coined from the Lord’s prayer taught by Jesus
Christ to His disciples. PDB provides decent lunch meals for identified students who will be
screened basically for involuntary hunger due to poverty.
